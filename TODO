/*! \page issues Muggle Issue List

  The page lists a number of open issues and possible ideas for improvement.
  It can be seen as a notepad for the developers or as an entry point for
  volunteers. There is no real order among those things and even the occurrence
  of an issue does not mean that it will be implemented/resolved at some time.

  If you feel, something is really urgent, go ahead. We'll help you.

  \section urgent Urgent/Short-term issues

    \subsection bugs Bugs and testing needed
       - Cover images from id3 tags
       - When no tags in file can be found and no 

    \subsection urgentosd OSD-related Issues
       - Move items within playlists

    \subsection urgentcode Code polishing
        - Generate HTML documentation using doxygen,
          - use dotty/gv for state machines of player

    \subsection urgentcontent Content handling    

    \subsection urgentplayer Player extensions
        - Possible to resume play instead of restarting list from the beginning?
	- Init scale/level/normalize?
	  - The max. level should be recognized during play
	  - Store max. level in the database

  \section mid ToDo items of moderate importance
  
    \subsection midimport Import stuff
    
    - Album
      - Cover text

    - Tracks
      - Language (?) - encoded by what standard?
      - Rating?
      - Modified, created
      - Lyrics

    - Import playlist from m3u
    - define regexp per import field for things like s'/^The//'

    \subsection midcode Code issues
    
	\subsection midosd OSD-related issues
        - can mgMenu and mgMainMenu be combined into one class?	
	- can mgActions inherit from cOsdItem?
	- Check whether submenus (as implemented in VDR) are more suitable
	    - do not permit jumping to arbitrary menus though

	\subsection midcontent filter issues

        - new OSD list for filters. Only ONE filter can be active at any time
	- filters can be defined recursively, different filters can share subfilters
	- Save/load filter set
	  - table filters and filterrules
	    - filters: id, name, created, author. Uses id 0 from filterrules.
	    - filterrules: PRIMARY(filterid, id), negate, operator, op1, op2, 
	    - if operator is AND or OR, op1 and op2 are filterrule ids
	- filters are always applied, even to "instant play" and "now playing"

	\subsection midcontent Content issues

	- Handle ratings (increase/decrease during replay)
	    - Keys to directly increase
	    - handle a playcounter and use it to influence rating

	\subsection midplayer Player issues
	
        - Use single CD files with cuesheets in metadata for FLAC
	- Handle recoding samplerate, limiter etc correctly
        - Let decoding run in a thread of its own
    
	\section vision Long term ideas and visions

	- handle off-line media (CDs, DVDs, recordings)
	- handle streams (live TV with channel list, MP3 radio,..., EPG)	
	- handle images (possibly in sync with music/radio)
	- muggle content syndication (e.g. via DAAPD)
	  - access media on someone elses computer
	- provide a stream (e.g. icecast) of the currently played music?
