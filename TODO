/*! \page issues Muggle Issue List

  The page lists a number of open issues and possible ideas for improvement.
  It can be seen as a notepad for the developers or as an entry point for
  volunteers. There is no real order among those things and even the occurrence
  of an issue does not mean that it will be implemented/resolved at some time.

  If you feel, something is really urgent, go ahead. We'll help you.

  \section urgent Urgent issues

    \subsection bugs Bugs and testing needed
    
    - Test execution of playlist commands
    - Keep this? Test mgPCMPlayer::getSourceFile() for GD case (find)
    - Test saving/loading playlists to database

    \subsection urgentosd OSD-related Issues

	- Add play indicators
	  - Toggle display with Ok (off -> track info -> album info -> playlist info -> off)
	  - Display track info
	    - Song title
	    - Artist
	    - Genre
	    - Album
	    - Bitrate, channels, samplerate, format, ...
	    - Progress display
	  - Display album info

    \subsection urgentcode Code polishing
    
	- Check for unnecessary log commands
	- Generate HTML documentation using doxygen,
		- use dotty/gv for state machines of player
		- make available online
	- Clean up mugglei (abstract code where possible)
	- Check for memory leaks
	    - Why do filters use pointers?
	- Check for (reasonably) consistent usage of char pointers and strings

	- mgDatabase is not used? 
		- should handle a static object with a MySQL connection
		- execute queries?
	- mgPlayer used what for?
		- Could save IP/host name and associate last playlist loaded

    \subsection urgentcontent Content handling
    
	- Think, whether type (mp3, ogg, flac) should be stored in database
	- Handle loop mode in mgPlaylist (already done?)
	- Handle shuffle mode in mgPlaylist
    - Party mode (see iTunes)
    
	\subsection urgentplayer Player extensions
	
	- Determine max. framecount (needed for rewinding)?
	- Init scale/level/normalize?
	  - The max. level should be recognized during play
	  - Store max. level in the database

    \subsection deploy Deployment

	- Script to publish a version
		- make dist
		- copy .tgz, README, CHANGES, HISTORY into web directory
		- generate documentation
		- copy into web directory
		- sync with web
		- How to track bugs and feature requests?

		\verbatim
		# $1: version name (e.g. 0.0.5-BETA)

		# how to determine current path?
		svn copy ... http://.../svn/muggle/tags/$1

		make dist
		# obtain name from output? or copy commands and make correctly
		mv vdr-muggle-0.0.1.tgz ~/Web/current/htpc/muggle/vdr-muggle-$1.tgz

		cp README ...
		cp TODO ...
		cp CHANGES ...

		doxygen muggle.doxygen
		cp -R doc ~/Web/current/htpc/muggle/

		sitecopy --update htpctech
		\endverbatim
      
  \section mid ToDo items of moderate importance
  
    \subsection midimport Import stuff
    
	- Album
		- Genre
		- Modified
		- Cover text
		- Cover images (based on filename or tag)

	- Tracks
		- Language (?)
		- Genre1, 2
		- Rating?
		- Modified, created
		- Lyrics

	- Import playlist from m3u
	- Run import/update from within OSD?
    - Handle updates in both directions
        - Check modification date in DB/fstat
        - if file is newer: update tags into db
        - if DB is newer: update db into tags
    
    \subsection midcode Code issues
    
	- really abstract from specific queries etc.
	- mgDatabase should completely abstract database (mySQL) stuff!?
		- read/write queries
		- return results (needs a homogeneous representation of results?)
		
	\subsection midosd OSD-related issues
	
	- Incremental search 
		- Type numbers to enter characters and jump to first title accordingly
	- Check whether submenus (as implemented in VDR) are more suitable
	    - do not permit jumping to arbitrary menus though

	\subsection midcontent Content issues
	
	- Save/load filter sets
	- Apply filter set as dynamic playlist (i.e. show filters when loading playlists)
	- Handle ratings (increase/decrease during replay)
	    - Keys to directly increase
	    - handle a playcounter
	        - when playfrequency reaches lower level x from above: decrease rating
	        - when playfrequency reaches lower level x from below: increase rating
	        - when playfrequency reaches upper level y from above: decrease rating
	        - when playfrequency reaches upper level y from below: increase rating

	\subsection midplayer Player issues
	
	- Display covers
	- Add flac decoder
    
	\section vision Long term ideas and visions

	- daapd integration?
	- netjuke integration?
	- Display arbitrary images while playing music

	- handle off-line media (CDs, DVDs, recordings)
	- handle streams (live TV with channel list, MP3 radio,..., EPG)
	
	- handle images (possibly in sync with music/radio)
	- muggle content syndication (e.g. via DAAPD)
	  - access media on someone elses computer
	- provide a stream (e.g. icecast) of the currently played music?
      - allow remote stations to attach to this

  \section done Done
  
	- Check play speed (was XINE related)
	- Playlists starts with 2nd song (DONE)
	- Export playlists
	- Delete selected item
	- Add command line option for top level directory
	- prepended to filename in non-GD-mode
	- searched in GD-mode
	- Edit playlist (move tracks like channels in VDR channel list)
		(OK in playlist view)
	- Instant play = empty current playlist, append tracks of current node and play
		(easy, in submenu of browser)
	- Clear playlist (submenu action)
	- Find files from database entry based on GD compatibility flag
	- Handle Next/PrevFile in mgPlaylist (vdr_player.c)
	- Add plugin parameters for database name/host/user/pass
	- Add plugin parameter for GD filename compatibility
	- handle filters:
		- create tracklist from filter
		- create tree from filter
	- i18n (english and german)
	- Album import
	- Various artists
	- Ogg/Vorbis decoder integration
		- cOggFile kept
		- cOggInfo dismissed in favor of obtaining info from DB
		- coding conventions adapted
		- Schema extended to keep audio properties
		- Import (mugglei) extended to store audio properties in DB 
			(most notably samplerate, no. channels)
		- Extended mgContentItem with audio properties
		- Extended mgGdTrack with audio properties (bitrate, samplerate, channels)
		- in mgPCMPlayer/vdr_player.c:
			- pass m_playing to mp3/ogg decoder (instead of filename)
		- mgOggDecoder: obtain audio properties from DB (channels, sampling rate via mgContentItem)
		- mgPCMPlayer::getSourceFile moved to abstract data layer (mgContentItem)
			and made concrete in subclasses (mgGdTrack)
		- mgDecoders::findDecoder: extend decoder detection
		- Check compatibility for 1.3.12 (DONE)
