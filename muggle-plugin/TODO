TODO File for Muggle
====================

Code polishing
==============
- Check for memory leaks
- Check for (reasonably) consistent usage of char*/string
- mgDatabase is not used? mgPlayer used what for?
- Check for unnecessary log commands
- Add logs, documentation (generate in HTML)
- Generate HTML documentation using doxygen, dotty/gv for state machines

Short term items
================
- Adapt scripts
  - use working directory by default or argument
  - how to install into correct path

OSD
---

Content
-------
- Handle loop mode in mgPlaylist
- Handle shuffle mode in mgPlaylist
- Save/load playlists to database

Player
------
- Determine max. framecount (needed for rewinding) ?
- Init scale/level/normalize?
- Check play speed
- Add ogg decoder

- Add a simple progress display (song title, artist, ...)
- DisplayTrackInfo (part of the player!)
- DisplayAlbumInfo (part of the player!)

Medium term items
=================

- really abstract from specific queries etc.
- mgDatabase should abstract database stuff!?

OSD
---
- Type numbers to enter characters and jump to first title accordingly
- Add separators for first letter (A, B, C, ...) that can be skipped using left/right

Content
-------
- Save/load filter sets
- Apply filter set as dynamic playlist

Player
------
- Shuffle: toggle and loop keys. Shuffle only songs not already played, not easy though
- Display covers as still pictures
- Add flac decoder

Web interface
-------------
- Look at PHP stuff from c't 11/04 and adapt to schema

Long term ideas
===============
- daapd integration?
- Display arbitrary images while playing music

Visions
=======
- handle off-line films (CDs, DVDs, recordings)
- handle streams (live TV with channel list, MP3 radio,..., EPG)
- handle images (possibly in sync with music/radio)
- muggle content syndication (e.g. via DAAPD)
- provide a stream (e.g. icecast) of the currently played music?

Already Done
============
- Delete selected item
- Add command line option for top level directory
   - prepended to filename in non-GD-mode
   - searched in GD-mode
- Edit playlist (move tracks like channels in VDR channel list)
  (OK in playlist view)
- Instant play = empty current playlist, append tracks of current node and play
  (easy, in submenu of browser)
- Clear playlist (submenu action)
- Find files from database entry based on GD compatibility flag
- Handle Next/PrevFile in mgPlaylist (vdr_player.c)
- Add plugin parameters for database name/host/user/pass
- Add plugin parameter for GD filename compatibility
- handle filters:
    - create tracklist from filter
    - create tree from filter
- i18n (english and german)
