\section prereq PREREQUISITES

You will need:

 - postgresql client libraries: Debian package postgresql-client
 - postgresql server, possibly on another machine: Debian package postgresql
 - postgresql-dev for the compilation

Please execute these steps before starting muggle the first time:
(tested on Debian unstable)

1. log in as root
2. su - postgres
3. createuser vdr
4. createdb GiantDisc


Everything else will be done by muggle.

\section install INSTALLING 

Adapt the Makefile or Make.config to your system. Define HAVE_PG

HAVE_PG=1


\section SET UP MUGGLE WITH POSTGRESQL

Embedded MySQL means simpler configuration because you do not have 
to login into a remote data base server. You will only need the argument
-d Directory. muggle will store the data base in that directory. Start
mugglei without arguments for details.

\section SET UP MUGGLE WITH REMOTE MYSQL

Muggle and mugglei use a small set of parameters in order to control
the interaction with the Postgresql server. Let's look at an example:

\verbatim
  -P'muggle -h /tmp -u vdr -t/home/music'
\endverbatim

The -h parameter says to look for a socket in /tmp (this is what I
had to to on Debian unstable). 

Start mugglei without arguments to see a list and explanation of
all available options. They can vary slightly depending on the
chosen data base software.
