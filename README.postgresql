\section prereq PREREQUISITES

You will need:

 - postgresql client libraries: Debian package postgresql-client
 - postgresql server, possibly on another machine: Debian package postgresql
 - postgresql-dev for the compilation

Please execute these steps before starting muggle the first time:
(tested on Debian unstable)

1. log in as root
2. su - postgres
3. createuser XXX
4. createdb GiantDisc

under ubuntu:
1. sudo -u postgres createuser XXX
2. sudo -u postgres createdb GiantDisc


where XXX is the user name vdr is running under, normally vdr.
You may want to define the database encoding as UTF8, see 
http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.3/interactive/multibyte.html.
This is not strictly necessary - postgresql will otherwise 
convert data between server and client automatically.

Everything else will be done by muggle.

\section install INSTALLING 

Adapt the Makefile or Make.config to your system. Define HAVE_PG

HAVE_PG=1


\section SET UP MUGGLE WITH POSTGRESQL

Muggle and mugglei use a small set of parameters in order to control
the interaction with the Postgresql server. Let's look at an example:

\verbatim
  -P'muggle -s /tmp -t/home/music'
\endverbatim

The -s parameter says to look for a socket in /tmp (this is what I
had to to on Debian unstable). 

On the other hand on my kubuntu 7.10 notebook I don't need any
additional arguments at all:

\verbatim
  -P'muggle -t/home/music'
\endverbatim


Starting mugglei without arguments to see a list and explanation of
all available options. They can vary slightly depending on the
chosen data base software.
