\section prereq PREREQUISITES

You will need:

 - the sqlite3 library: Debian package sqlite3
 - the Debian package libsqlite3-dev for the compilation

\section install INSTALLING 

Adapt the Makefile or Make.config to your system. Define

HAVE_SQLITE=1


\section SET UP MUGGLE WITH SQLITE

SQLITE means simpler configuration because you do not have 
to login into a remote data base server. You will only need the argument
-d Directory. muggle will store the data base in that directory. There 
is a default, so you can even omit -d. Start mugglei without arguments
for details.
