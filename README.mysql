\section prereq PREREQUISITES

You will need:

 - mySQL client libraries
   (Debian package libmysqlclient-dev or 
    http://www.mysql.org)
 - mySQL server (tested with 4.0.18) (Debian packages mysql-server,
   mysql-client) only needed, if you want to run the database server
   on a remote machine

The developer versions are needed because their headers are required
for compilation. The server need not be on the same machine as the
VDR. Also, music tracks can reside somewhere else, if they are
available through a remote filesystem (NFS, Samba). However, in this
case you should know what you are doing in terms of networking and
security issues.

\section install INSTALLING 

Adapt the Makefile or Make.config to your system. Define HAVE_MYSQL
and HAVE_ONLY_SERVER if you do not want the embedded version.

HAVE_MYSQL=1
HAVE_ONLY_SERVER=1

NOTE: If the package mysql-server is not installed on your machine you might
see an error message like this:

050306  9:29:14 Can't find messagefile '/usr/share/mysql/english/errmsg.sys'
050306  9:29:14 Aborting

In this case you need to obtain these files and put them there.

Then you can build and install the plugin as described in README


\section SET UP MUGGLE WITH EMBEDDED MYSQL

Embedded MySQL means simpler configuration because you do not have 
to login into a remote data base server. You will only need the argument
-d Directory. muggle will store the data base in that directory. Start
mugglei without arguments for details.

NOTE: The embedded MySQL server cannot be used by other programs. 

NOTE: The GiantDisc web interface only works with remote MySQL.


\section SET UP MUGGLE WITH REMOTE MYSQL

If you already have a MySQL server running in your network (e.g. as a basis
for a webserver) or want to access the music database with other programs
(e.g. the GiantDisc web interface) you may be interested in using

\section config MUGGLE CONFIGURATION

When using the remote MySQL server, muggle and mugglei use a small set of
parameters in order to control the interaction with the mySQL server. Let's
look at an example:

\verbatim
  -P'muggle -h localhost -u vdr -p pw -n GiantDisc -t/home/music'
\endverbatim

The -h parameter specifies the database host, -u specifies the user,
-p specifies the password, -n is the database name.

Start mugglei without arguments to see a list and explanation of
all available options. They can vary slightly depending on the
chosen data base software.
